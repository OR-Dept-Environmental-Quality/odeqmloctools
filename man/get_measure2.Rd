\title{Get measure value along a line}
\usage{
get_measure2(line, point, id, return_df = FALSE, nhdplus = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{line}{The input NHD feature as an sf object with a geometry column.}

\item{point}{The input point feature as an sf object with a geometry column}

\item{id}{Column name in 'line' used to identify the polyline and calculate
measure distance along. Typically 'ReachCode' or 'REACHCODE'.}

\item{return_df}{Boolean. A TRUE value will return the data
frame with columns for Measure, Snap.Lat, Snap.Long, and Snap.Distance.
FALSE will return the measure value
as a character. Default is FALSE.}

\item{nhdplus}{Boolean. Default is FALSE. A TRUE value will use the NHDplus fields
'TOMEAS' and 'FROMMEAS' in the measure calculation instead of the m value
from the feature geometry. NHDplus geometry returned
from USGS's REST service does not include a m value by default.}
}
\description{
Calculate the measure value given an input point and NHD line. The measure value is
determined after snapping the point to the line.
